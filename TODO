PRIORITIES
- clean all my scripts/examples
- add add more examples (my tests) for complex scripts
- add tree alt spendin
  . separate method that constructs merkle path from ControlBlock ??!?
- load public key with x-only pubkey, ensure it works for several...
- create Address object that covers ALL addresses and can convert from one to another!
- clean .from_raw in the transaction object!?!

SEGWIT-related
- A '00' byte needs to be added for non-witness inputs in between witness (inputs-witnesses are 1-1!) automatically?
  . currently adding it manually works fine (see 3 inputs 1 output example)
  . think of clean way of automating this (auto-magically adding them could confuse users!)
- explain get_transaction_segwit_digest() better and test further
- clean and comment the segwit examples !
  . add more segwit txs tests including nested ones
- segwit v0 and v1 address object instantiates from address, witness program and script
  . are all used? test?
- add Taproot to Transaction.from_raw
  . test from_raw more
  . crean up from_raw code in general
- add annex to signature hash (easy, just add in bytes or hex in the method and include)
- ControlBlock does not handle sign bit for batch validation (tweak_public_key needs to return a second return value - negated)

CLEAN UP 
-- utils' to_bytes used in from_raw -- clean/reuse appropriate one
   . hex -> bytes use bytes.fromhex(he_str) instead of unhexlify??
   . b'bbbb'.hex() instead of hexlify!! (remove all and binascii)
   . create h_to_i, i_to_h, h_to_b, b_to_h, b_to_i, i_to_b ?!
-- rename VarInt to CompactSize
-- utils tests a lot for even with y % 2 !=0 - shall we make a utils method?
-- TxWitnessInput/Script can take objects and call the appr. method to hexlify after inspecting the obj.
-- USE type hints everywhere, make aliases to support objects, etc.

IMPROVE
- test proxy object extensively, students reports it fails sometimes...

DOC-related
- add explicit documentation for each module before members...
- commit docs/usage/proxy.rst
- segwit in documentation

tests-related
- move data inside tests - self-contained tests
- improve test structure - look at python-bitcointx for example

WINDOWS
- it seems that the default port does not work on windows; need to specify the port explicitly in NodeProxy

OTHERLIBS-related
- add to bitcoin-rpc lib option to ignore invalid ssl cert
  . needed to access remotely withut cert (for other validators from clients)
  . https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc/pull/50
  . but not in a lib release yet
  . add config.ini option to optionally ignore cert so that it works when calling btcd remotely
- create HD wallet implementation - very simple - similar to the hdwallet lib that I wrap
- create block object and allow .from_block(..) instantiation

OTHER
- reminder: update copyright in all files 2018-2022?
- create script: clean-less-than-sats 100000 bc1q86gsg4t32...
- create test with 260 outputs (inputs too much trouble) - file: test_extreme_txs.py
- create test with script of 260 and another with 66000 commands
- make test of send to P2WPKH transaction example
- maybe make RBF the default from now on (like Bitcoin Core)
  . will need to change all the tests, unless I add minor hack that uses RBF by default only for taproot
